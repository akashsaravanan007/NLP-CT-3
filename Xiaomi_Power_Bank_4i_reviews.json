The power bank is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around in my bag or pocket.One of the things that impressed me the most about this power bank is its fast charging capability. With its 18W fast charging feature, my devices charge up quickly, saving me time and keeping me connected throughout the day.The power bank's dual input ports make it convenient for me to charge it with either a Micro-USB or Type C cable, depending on what's available. This feature ensures that I'm always able to charge my devices even when I'm on the go.The design of the power bank is sleek and stylish, and the Midnight Black color adds a touch of sophistication. The LED indicator lights also make it easy to check the power bank's battery level, so I always know when it's time to recharge.Overall, I highly recommend the Mi 10000mAH Li-Polymer Power Bank 3i with Micro-USB and Type C Input Port in Midnight Black to anyone in need of a reliable and efficient power bank.
